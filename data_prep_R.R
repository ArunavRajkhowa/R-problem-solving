# Problem 2 -----------------------------------------------------
  # There were many categorical variables which had many more distinct categories and making n-1 dummy
  # variables might not be a very good approach. What we can do instead is to bring down number of categories
  # 1   by combining similar categories. We saw this in one of the earlier practice assignment weâ€™ll build on top of
  # that.
  # Here is example code for creating dummy variables with grouping categories for variable workclass.
  # Note: Grouping is done on the basis of similar behaviour across classes of target [ which is Y
  #                                                                                     in this case]

# Problem 3 --------------
    library(dplyr)
    # Although we should generaly leave numeric variables as is                                       happen in regression modules], but sometimes there is particular value which occurs too many times in a
    # variable, in such cases you should make flag variables which
    # take value 0,1 in accordance when that variable
    # takes that particular values. Here is an example
    # of creating flag variable for variable capital.gain:
    
    # this will give % of observations where capital.gain is 0
    sum(ci$capital.gain==0)/nrow(ci)
    # More than 90% values are 0 , 
    # lets go ahead create a flag variable for this
    
    
    ci=ci %>%
      mutate(cg_flag0=as.numeric(capital.gain==0)) #1 where 0 CG
    
    # In the same manner check for what % of 
    # data capital.loss is zero and create a flag variable if this comes out
    # to be high
    sum(ci$capital.loss==0)/nrow(ci)
    #around 95% have values 0
    ci=ci %>%
      mutate(cl_flag0=as.numeric(capital.loss==0))
    
    
    
    
# Problem 4 -----------------------------
    # Converting the target
    # For running logistic regression your target needs to take values 0,1. 
    # Right now Y takes two categorical values.
    # convert them so that Y takes value when it is " >50K" and 0 otherwise
    ci = ci %>% 
        mutate(ifelse(Y==' >50K'," >50K",0))
      
  #or 
    ci$Y=as.numeric(ci$Y==" >50K")
